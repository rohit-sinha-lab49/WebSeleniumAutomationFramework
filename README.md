## Features

- **Selenium WebDriver Integration**: Easily write and run Selenium tests.
- **TestNG Framework**: Leverage the powerful TestNG framework for organizing and executing tests.
- **Allure Reporting**: Generate beautiful and detailed test reports with Allure.
- **Page Object Model**: Follow the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern for better maintainability.
- **Configurable**: Easily configure browser settings, test data, and more through property files.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher
- Maven 3.6 or higher
- ChromeDriver (or other WebDriver binaries as needed)
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repository>.git
    cd <your-repository>
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    mvn clean install
    ```

3. **Configure WebDriver binaries**:
    Ensure you have the appropriate WebDriver binaries (e.g., ChromeDriver) available in your system's PATH.

### Running Tests

1. **Run all tests**:
    ```sh
    mvn test
    ```

2. **Run a specific test suite**:
    ```sh
    mvn -Dtest=<TestSuiteName> test
    ```

### Generating Reports

After running the tests, you can generate Allure reports.

1. **Generate Allure report**:
    ```sh
    allure serve target/allure-results
    ```

This command will start a local server and open the Allure report in your default web browser.

### Explanation

- **pom.xml**: The Maven configuration file.
- **src**: The source directory.
  - **main**: The main source code directory.
    - **java**: The directory containing Java source files.
      - **com/yourpackage/pages**: The package containing Page Object Model (POM) classes.
      - **com/yourpackage/utils**: The package containing utility classes.
  - **test**: The test source code directory.
    - **java**: The directory containing Java test files.
      - **com/yourpackage/tests**: The package containing test classes.
    - **resources**: The resources directory for test configuration files.
      - **testng.xml**: The TestNG configuration file.
- **target**: The output directory for compiled files and generated reports.
  - **allure-results**: The directory where Allure test results are stored.

## Project Files and Directories

Here's a brief overview of important files and directories in the project:

- `pom.xml`: Maven project file containing dependencies and build configurations.
- `src/main/java/com/yourpackage/pages`: Contains Page Object Model classes, which represent the web pages.
- `src/main/java/com/yourpackage/utils`: Contains utility classes for common functions and helpers.
- `src/test/java/com/yourpackage/tests`: Contains the test classes with TestNG test cases.
- `src/test/resources/testng.xml`: Configuration file for TestNG.
- `target/allure-results`: Directory where Allure stores test results for generating reports.

## Example Usage

To run the tests and generate the Allure report, follow these steps:

1. **Run Tests**:
    ```sh
    mvn test
    ```

2. **Generate Allure Report**:
    ```sh
    allure serve target/allure-results
    ```

This will start a local server and open the Allure report in your default web browser.
